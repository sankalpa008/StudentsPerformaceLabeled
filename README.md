# StudentsPerformanceLabeled

## Overview

This project analyzes a labeled dataset of student performance to uncover insights into how various factors—such as gender, parental education level, and test preparation—affect academic outcomes. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to interpret the relationships within the data.

## Dataset

The dataset `StudentsPerformanceLabeled-4.csv` contains information on students' scores in math, reading, and writing, along with demographic and educational background variables.

## Contents

- `assignment3.py` – Loads data and performs initial preprocessing  
- `assignment4.py` – Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations  
- `assignment_5.py` – Applies further transformations and prepares data for modeling or extended analysis  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
